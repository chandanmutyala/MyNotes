The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles in Java:-

1) Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change, meaning it should have only one responsibility.
2) Open/Closed Principle (OCP):
Software entities (e.g., classes, modules) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
3) Liskov-Substitution Principle:
According to LSP, substituting the subclasses for the base class should work , and the expected behavior is maintained.
4) Interface Segregation Principle(ISP):
According to ISP it allows classes to implement only the interfaces that are relevant to their functionality.
5)Dependency Inversion principle (DIP):
DIP promotes a more flexible and adaptable design by inverting the direction of dependency in a system, allowing high-level and low-level modules to depend on abstractions rather than concrete details.
